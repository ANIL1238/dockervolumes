Got it! Here’s a complete `README.md` file example for your React app Docker project, including the **bind mount** command, explanations, and optional steps — all in one go and ready for your GitHub repo:

# React Todo App with Docker and Bind Mount

This repository contains a React Todo App configured to run inside a Docker container  
using **bind mounts** for live code updates without rebuilding the image.

---

## Prerequisites

- Docker installed on your server/machine
- React app source code located at `/home/b2buser/test_docker/reactodo/todo-app`

---

## How to Run

### Run Docker Container with Bind Mount

This command mounts your local React app directory into the container, so any changes you make locally  
will reflect inside the container immediately:

```bash
docker run -it --rm -v /home/b2buser/test_docker/reactodo/todo-app:/app -w /app -p 8080:80 liveapp-v2
````

* `-v /home/b2buser/test_docker/reactodo/todo-app:/app` mounts your host directory to `/app` inside the container
* `-w /app` sets the working directory inside the container
* `-p 8080:80` maps port 8080 on the host to port 80 inside the container
* `--rm` removes the container when it stops
* `-it` runs the container interactively (you can access the shell)

---

### Optional: Start container with shell and manually run React app

If your image doesn't automatically run the React app, you can start a container with shell access:

```bash
docker run -it --rm -v /home/b2buser/test_docker/reactodo/todo-app:/app -w /app -p 8080:3000 liveapp-v2 bash
```

Inside the container shell, run:

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

* This will start the React development server accessible on port 3000 (mapped to host port 8080)

---

## Notes

* Your changes to files in `/home/b2buser/test_docker/reactodo/todo-app` will be reflected live inside the container because of the bind mount.
* Ensure `npm` and `node` are installed in the Docker image `liveapp-v2` for development commands (`npm install` and `npm start`) to work.
* The container assumes your React app's root is at `/app` inside the container.

---

## Dockerfile Example (for reference)

Here’s a basic example Dockerfile to build `liveapp-v2`:

```dockerfile
FROM node:18-alpine

WORKDIR /app

COPY package.json package-lock.json ./
RUN npm install

COPY . .

EXPOSE 3000

CMD ["npm", "start"]
```

---

## Summary

This setup enables fast React development inside Docker with live updates through bind mounts
without needing to rebuild the image after every change.
